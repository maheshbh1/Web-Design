    <h2>Facts about CSS</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>According to Wikipedia, CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. 
          <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></li>
       <li>The first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) was released in 1996.</li>
       <li>CSS was selected over competing stylesheet technologies because CSS <cite>allowed a document's 
          style to be influenced by multiple stylesheets by way of "cascading".</cite> 
          <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></li>
       <li>Four years passed from when CSS1 was released before any browser fully supported CSS1.
